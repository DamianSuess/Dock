# Dock Documentation

Welcome to the Dock documentation.  The files in this folder describe how to
use the Dock layout system from simple getting started examples to
advanced customization scenarios.  The documents assume you have an
Avalonia application created with the .NET SDK.  If you are new to Dock
start with the MVVM guide and work your way towards the deep dive.

## Guides

- [MVVM Guide](dock-mvvm.md) – Build layouts using MVVM view models.
- [ReactiveUI Guide](dock-reactiveui.md) – ReactiveUI equivalent of the MVVM guide.
- [XAML Guide](dock-xaml.md) – Declare layouts purely in XAML.
- [Reference Guide](dock-reference.md) – Overview of the core APIs.
- [Advanced Guide](dock-advanced.md) – Custom factories and runtime features.
- [Events Guide](dock-events.md) – Subscribing to dock and window events.
- [API Scenarios](dock-api-scenarios.md) – Common coding patterns.
- [Architecture Overview](dock-architecture.md) – High level design of the docking system.
- [Deep Dive](dock-deep-dive.md) – Internals of `DockControl`.

See the sample applications under the [samples](../samples/) directory for real-world usage.
The [project README](../README.md) also lists the available guides and provides
basic build instructions.
